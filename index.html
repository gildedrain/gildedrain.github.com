            <h4>GUI Framework</h4>
            <p>In the days before Twitter Bootstrap, I put together my own custom built CSS and Javascript framework made up of reusable tool classes and simple scripts that can be applied to any HTML.  The overall intent is for someone with minimal familiarity with HTML and CSS syntax to be able to apply these visual effects by calling the classnames.</p>
            <p>How was I to know that Twitter was going to release their framework no sooner than I finished mine?  Not only that, but several intelligent frameworks have been released since I came up with the idea for GUI.  Many of them are better at what they do and the open source community has really accelerated their development and quality. OCC has been using GUI for a few years now and seems very satisfied with the power it gives them. GUI isn't perfect, but it's a labor of love and I'm continually adding to and improving it. </p>
            <p>All of that being said, I think it's worthwhile for any designer or programmer to attempt to create their own framework.  The knowledge and experience you learn along the way is priceless.</p>

            <p>In the days before Twitter Bootstrap, I put together my own custom built CSS and Javascript framework made up of reusable tool classes and simple scripts that can be applied to any HTML.  The overall intent is for someone with minimal familiarity with HTML and CSS syntax to be able to apply these visual effects by calling the classnames.</p>
            <p>How was I to know that Twitter was going to release their framework no sooner than I finished mine?  Not only that, but several intelligent frameworks have been released since I came up with the idea for GUI.  Many of them are better at what they do and the open source community has really accelerated their development and quality. OCC has been using GUI for a few years now and seems very satisfied with the power it gives them. GUI isn't perfect, but it's a labor of love and I'm continually adding to and improving it. </p>
            <p>All of that being said, I think it's worthwhile for any designer or programmer to attempt to create their own framework.  The knowledge and experience you learn along the way is priceless.</p>
