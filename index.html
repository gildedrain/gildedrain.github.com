		<h2>Here's my approach.</h2>
		<div class="subsection flexrow">
			<img src="images/sketches.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt=" " />
			<div>
				<h3>Start with a sketch.</h3>
				<p>A quick sketch is the fastest way to remove the fog of confusion and pave the way for effective problem-solving &mdash; whether on a whiteboard, on a napkin, or in the dirt.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Gather the requirements.</li> 
					<li>Get the team to see the problem visually.</li>  
					<li>Show where we are and where we're going.</li> 
					<li>Show how it's all interconnected.</li>  
					<li>Guide the brainstorm.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="subsection flexrow">
			<img src="images/sitemap.jpg"  width="300" height="300"  alt=" " />
			<div>			
				<h3>Swim around a bit.</h3>
				<p>Learn all there is to know about the problem and the spaces surrounding it. A little extra time here can save a bundle down the line.</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Zoom out and look at the bigger picture.</li> 
					<li>Map the user's journey.</li>  
					<li>Think of things the client didn't.</li> 
					<li>Make sure we all understand what problem we're working to solve.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="subsection flexrow">
			<img src="images/design.jpg" width="300" height="300"  alt=" " />
			<div>			
				<h3>Design with intent.</h3>
				<p>Keep the user in mind throughout the design process and remained focused on the problem we're working to solve.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Simplify & Streamline. </li>
					<li>Plan for the worst-case scenarios.</li>  
					<li>Leverage the systems already in place.</li> 
					<li>Make it pretty.</li> 
					<li>Get more eyes on it.</li>  
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="subsection flexrow">
			<img src="images/code.jpg" width="300" height="300"  alt=" " />
			<div>			
				<h3>Build it together.</h3>
				<p>Every project is a team effort.  Encourage teamwork and clarity by translating complicated problems between managers, designers, engineers and customers.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Make it work &ndash; for every user on every device.</li>
					<li>Make it reusable &ndash; for us.</li>
					<li>Test it with the client as soon as possible.</li>  
					<li>Launch it!</li>
					<li>Ask what went right & wrong?</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Here's a selection of my work.</h2>
		<h3>15 years managing an evolving ecosystem of websites for Higher Ed</h3>
		<p>Directed multiple redesigns, redevelopments, and realigns.  Organized complicated information architectures for multiple audiences and business pipelines. Added new functionality, standalone web apps, and 3rd party integrations.  Created a library of reusable code and style objects.  Managed massive content migrations to new content management systems. Led, trained and mentored a dozen team members in key web concepts, HTML & CSS, user-centered design, user journey mapping, information architecture, usability testing, web accessibility, content strategy, and content management.</p>

		<h3>Reimagined the entire business process to create a better UX</h3>
		<p>What started as a simple whiteboard sketch to help me better understand an isolated issue revealed systemic problems across the entire business process.  Given the opportunity to explore more deeply, I reimagined how Higher Ed might better operate. I advocated for removing hurdles for students and encouraged the adoption of successful customer service models from other industries.  The resulting concept sketch ignited multiple projects across the College, serving as a roadmap for strategic planning at the highest levels. Waves can still be seen today as they make sweeping changes in how they operate and treat their customers.</p>
