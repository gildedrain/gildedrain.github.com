		<h2>Here's my approach.</h2>

<div class="subsection">
			<img src="images/sketches.jpg" alt=" " class="left" />
				<div><h3>It always starts with a sketch.</h3>
<p>A quick sketch is the fastest way to remove the fog of confusion and pave the way for effective problem-solving &mdash; whether on a whiteboard, on a napkin, or in the dirt.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get the team to see the problem visually.</li>  
	<li>Guide the collaborative effort.</li>
	<li>Give context to changes in the process.</li> 
	<li>Show how it's all interconnected.</li>  
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
			<img src="images/sitemap.jpg"  alt=" " class="left" />
<div>			<h3>Swim in it.</h3>
<p>Learn all there is to know about the problem and the spaces surrounding it.</p> 
<ul><li>Gather the requirements.</li> 
	<li>Zoom out and look at the bigger picture.</li> 
	<li>Map the user's journey.</li>  
	<li>Think of things the customer didn't.</li> 
	<li>Make sure we all understand what problem we're working to solve.</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
		<img src="images/design.jpg" alt=" " class="left" />
		<div>			<h3>Design with purpose.</h3>

			<p>Turn the music up and get into a flow. This is where I long to be.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Simplify.</li> 
			<li>Streamline.</li> 
			<li>Solve the problem.</li>
			<li>Plan for the worst-case scenarios.</li>  
			<li>Make it pretty.</li> 
			<li>Get more eyes on it.</li>  
	</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="subsection">
			<img src="images/code.jpg" alt=" " class="left" />
<div>			<h3>Build it together.</h3>
<p>Every project is a team effort.  Encourage teamwork and clarity by translating complicated problems between managers, designers, engineers and customers.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make it accessible.</li>  
		<li>Make it responsive and browser agnostic.</li>
		<li>Make it reusable.</li>
		<li>Test it with the customer as soon as possible.</li>  
		<li>Launch it!</li>
	</ul>

				<h2>Here's a selection of my work.</h2>

					<h3>15 years managing an evolving ecosystem of websites for Higher Ed.</h3>
		<div class="subsection">
<!--					<img src="images/sketches.jpg" alt=" " /> -->
						<div><p>Directed multiple redesigns, redevelopments, and realigns.  Organized an evolving and ever-improving information architecture. Added new functionality, standalone web apps, 3rd party integrations.  Created a library of reusable code and style objects.  Managed massive content migrations to new CMSes. Led, trained and mentored a dozen team members in key web concepts, content strategy, web accessibility, content management, markup and styling, user journey mapping, information architecture, usability testing, and user-centered design.</p>
	
				<h3>Reimagined the entire business process to create a better customer experience.</h3>
	<div class="subsection">
<!--					<img src="images/sketches.jpg" alt=" " /> -->					<div><p>What started as a simple whiteboard sketch to help me better understand an isolated problem revealed a systemic problem across the entire business process of the college.  Given the opportunity to explore more deeply, I reimagined how Higher Ed might operate. I advocated for removing hurdles for students and encouraged the adoption of successful customer service models from other industries.  The resulting concept sketch ignited multiple projects across the College. Waves can still be seen today as they make sweeping changes in how they operate and treat their customers.</p>
				
				<h3>Keeping busy with side hustles.</h3>
	<div class="subsection">
<!--					<img src="images/sketches.jpg" alt=" " /> -->
					<div><p>I do a bit of branding and illustration. Different thought processes. Keeps me flexible.</p>
